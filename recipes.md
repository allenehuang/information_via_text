### Pork Belly

* Didn't cook it long enough the first time and made wife sick. Cooked it for 1 hour initially. Cooked it for 2 more hours the next day. Seasoning seemed ok, just needs to cook for a long time.
* Consider using crockpot on high for 6-8 hours.

### Short Rib

* Turned out ok. Didn't have ginger and added 1-2 TBSP of honey. Made it too sweet. Consider cutting back on brown sugar. Also only had 1.5 cloves of garlic.
